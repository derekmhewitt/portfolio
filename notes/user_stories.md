User Stories: MVP

- As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST. This means your links to NOT navigate to a new page. Instead, your "single page app" shows only the section related to the navigation tab that is selected. You can use 'data-' attributes to associate a content section with a particular tab Then use jQuery so when the tab is clicked, you hide all the sections, then reveal the associated section only.
- As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visually.

Stretch Goals:

As a reader, I want any lengthy descriptions truncated to the first paragraph so that I can easily scroll though the whole list.
As a reader, I want to click the "More" button so that I can expand the entire description.
As a reader, I want projects filterable by category so that I can review just the things that interest me.

User Stories: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Let these user stories guide your development:

As a developer, I want my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
As the creator, I want the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.
As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.
As a developer, I want my CSS organized (think SMACSS) so that I can find my stylings swiftly.
